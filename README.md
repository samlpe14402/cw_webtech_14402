## What does this website do?
This website "sells" recreational drugs. Certified by WHO. Nothing funny going on here... <br/>
It is a replication of a website from a popular Netflix TV Show "How To Sell Drugs Online (Fast)". The idea of making a website to sell drugs sounded ammusing and fun. Developing this website was much more fun than I could imagine. <br/>
It is believed that my tutor who assesses my work will not be too harsh on this concept.
